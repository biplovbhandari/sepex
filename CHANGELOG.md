# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. During initial development phase, expect breaking API and YAML schema changes during minor updates. Patch updates are guaranteed to be backward compatible during this phase.]

## Unreleased

### API

#### POST /processes/:processID/execution

- Added optional `tags` array to execution payload. Tags are stored with the job record and can be used to filter jobs when querying `/jobs`.

#### GET /jobs

- Job responses now includes the `tags` field.

### Configuration

- New `SEPEX_DOCKER_NETWORK` environment variable (default: `sepex_net`) to set the docker network that launched job containers are attached to. Set it to `host` to run them with host networking, which is required on EC2 for instance profile credential access.
- AWS credentials (S3 and Batch) are now resolved through the default AWS credential chain rather than read directly from `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Deployments that set those variables are unaffected, deployments without them can authenticate with an ECS/EC2 instance role, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` is now honored for temporary credentials. MinIO continues to use its own `MINIO_*` keys.

### Fixed

- AWS Batch log stream lookup read the region from `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, which the API never defines, leaving the request without a region. All AWS calls now resolve the region from `AWS_REGION`.

## [0.2.2] - 2025-2-28

### API

#### POST /processes/:processID/execution

- Execution mode now determined per OGC API - Processes Requirements 25/26: honors `Prefer: respond-async` header when process supports both modes, defaults to sync otherwise
- Returns `Preference-Applied` response header when async preference is honored

#### GET /admin/resources

- New endpoint to view resource utilization for local jobs (docker, subprocess) and queue status

#### GET /jobs/:jobID/metadata

- Added `recoveryNotice` object to metadata format

### Features

- Added restart recovery for docker, subprocess, and AWS Batch jobs, including status reconciliation and log handling.
- Introduced `lost` job status and surfaced it in UI status indicators (job list, job logs, status table).
- Recovered jobs annotate metadata with a recovery notice and write best-effort metadata when some fields are missing.
- Resource pool can force-reserve resources for already-running recovered docker jobs.

### Configuration

- New `MAX_LOCAL_CPUS` and `MAX_LOCAL_MEMORY` environment variables (or `--max-local-cpus` and `--max-local-memory` CLI flags) to set resource limits for local job scheduling
- Process definitions are validated against these limits at startup and when adding/updating processes via API
- Processes without explicit resource requirements use default values

### Documentation

- Added sequence diagram for local scheduler
- Added Recovery section to DEV_GUIDE

## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-03

### API

- Version information is added in landing page.

### Configuration

- Repository URL is now configurable via `REPO_URL` environment variable. This URL is used for version links and metadata context references.

### Documentation

- Changelog updated to new format

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-02

### API

#### GET /jobs/:jobID/logs

- In response body `container_logs` key is replaced by `process_logs`

#### PUT|POST /processes/:processID

- Request payload schema has changed (See Process YAML Schema changes below)

### Process YAML Schema

- `command` is now a first class object and moved outside of `container`
- `config` object is added
- `maxResources` and `envVars` are moved under `config` object
- `image` moved under `host`
- `container` object removed
- `host.type` valid options are changed from `local` | `aws-batch` to `docker` | `aws-batch` | `subprocess`

### Features

- `subprocess` type processes now can be executed through API. They must be registered like other processes and will be called using OS subprocess calls.

### Documentation

- A `CHANGELOG.md` file is added in the repo.
- Process templates are provided for all three host types in `./process_templates` folder
- Windows setup instructions are added in `README.md`

## [0.1.0] - 2023-07-07

- Initial release with core API endpoints for process and job management
